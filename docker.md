A Docker image is a private file system just for your container.
It provides all the files and code your container needs.

Start a container based on the image you built.
Running a container launches your application with private resources,
securely isolated from the rest of your machine.

Save and share your image on Docker Hub to enable other users to easily download and run the image on any destination machine.
